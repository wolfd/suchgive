If you have questions, concerns, suggestions, etc. feel free to contact me.
</p>
<p>I am a student so my time is divided between my projects for school, my projects for important things (like this), and also life, so please understand if I do not respond quickly.</p>
<p>If you couldn't already tell, I do not do web design, and I am rather bad at it, if you want to help me out, let me know!</p>
<p>If you have found a security hole in the site, please contact me at the address listed below as well. Put "Suchgive Security:" in the subject line. Thank you for your help.</p>

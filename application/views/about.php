<h2>About</h2>
<p class="lead">
    Suchgive is a site dedicated to growing the dogecoin community and it's ventures in charitable giving.
</p>
<p>
    It started out and remains a crazy idea, but the small chance that it could work is enough.
</p>
<p>
    I plan to update this page with more information, and I will do so as soon as I can.

    <p class="lead">What is this?</p>
    <p>A website created to gamify charitable giving in the hope that it will encourage people to give more money, and give it faster.</p>

    <p class="lead">How does it work?</p>
    <p>Two charities are put head to head in a "charity battle" that lasts for a for a few days. During that time, users donate to the charity that they believe in most. Every time a donation is made, half of the Doge goes toward a "reward pool", and the other half goes directly to the charity's account. At the end of the battle, the charity that has the most Doge in their account is given the reward pool in addition to their normal earnings. The losing charity still gets the money in their account. Absolutely none of the money goes to me.</p>

    <p class="lead">How does the money get to the charities?</p>
    <p>If the charity takes Doge, I will transfer it directly to them. If the charity does not take Doge (which is likely the case), I will exchange the Doge into USD, and give the money to the charities in that way. I understand that my word is not good enough for many of you, so I will do the best I can to keep this process as public as possible. If you have any suggestions, please <a href="/contact">contact me.</a></p>

# suchgive
suchgive is a site that I never launched. Needs finishing touches and possibly a complete rewrite.

## The concept
A charity battle. Two charities race toward a funding goal, the first charity to get to the goal gets a reward pool. The reward pool is made up of half of the donations made. Each donation to a charity is split between a dedicated pool for that charity and the reward pool.

## The implementation
dogecoind, CodeIgniter PHP framework, magic.
